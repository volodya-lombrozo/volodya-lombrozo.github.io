This is the review of the "Complete Shadow Symbolic Execution with Java
PathFinder"
article that you can
find [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3364452.33644558).

# Meta

This article is written by five authors from Humboldt University: Yannic Noller,
Minxing Tang, Hoang Lam Nguyen, Lars Grunske, and Timo Kehrer. It was published
in [ACM SIGSOFT October 2019](https://dl.acm.org/newsletter/sigsoft).

Keywords: _Regression Testing, Symbolic Execution, Symbolic PathFinder_

| Conference  | Track                        | Year | Authors | Citations | Pages | Figures | References | Formals |

As you can see from the table above, this article is not very popular and
primarily holds practical value.

# What is the study about?

Actually, the article describes a possible method for generating test cases for
Java programs. The approach is based on Shadow Symbolic Execution (SSE), which
was previously discussed in
a [publication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3208952) from 2018 (source). This
article serves as a continuation and further exploration of that topic.
In other words, the approach described in the article enables the generation of
precise tests by leveraging the differential changes (patches) in the code.
While the previous SSE approach had limitations in detecting regression bugs,
the new approach aims to identify missed bugs at the cost of increased algorithm
execution time. In essence, SSE focused on specific paths of the Symbolic
Execution Tree, whereas the new approach aims to explore all possible paths.

# Contribution

So, the authors state the following contributions:

* They propose a new approach for generating test cases by combining complete
  symbolic execution with the concept of four-way forking.
* They introduce a tool called SHADOW JPF+ (an extension for SHADOW JPF) to
  validate the ideas presented in the article.
* They evaluate the implemented tool using various examples, including the
  [Joda-Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/) library.

As mentioned in the article, the authors have successfully addressed all the
problems that were identified. While it may not be considered a major
breakthrough in the industry or a significant innovation, it certainly
represents a noteworthy improvement over the previous approach and the existing
tool SHADOW JPF.

# Review

Let's take a closer look at the article. However, before we do, I'd like to
mention that I will provide a personal review in this section. I will discuss
the strengths of the article and also provide suggestions on how it can be
improved to enhance its quality. Again, it is solely my own perspective.

## Problem statement

The authors provide a comprehensive explanation of the current state-of-the-art
regarding the problem. They effectively describe the main concepts of Symbolic
Execution and Shadow Symbolic Execution, as well as the key challenges faced by
current approaches, such as:

- "Deeper divergence might be missed in the BSE phase"
- "The initial input has to cover potential divergence point"

Both of these points highlight the main issue with the current SSE solution -
its inability to uncover all possible paths of Symbolic Execution that could
potentially lead to bugs. The new solution presented in the article aims to
address this limitation.

So, it can be said that the problem statement is clear, and the authors provide
a solid explanation of the current state-of-the-art as well as their objectives
in addressing it.

## Innovation

As for the level of innovation, it can be challenging to make a definitive
judgment. On one hand, the approach presented in the article represents a
notable improvement over the previous method. However, on the other hand, it can
be seen as a programming solution and a modest step towards enhancing Symbolic
Execution. Therefore, it can be concluded that the level of innovation is
relatively small and holds primarily practical value. In other words, it is a
software solution that still possesses notable performance limitations.

Furthermore, even after four years since the article was published, we do not
have clear information about the practical utilization of the proposed solution.
However, as mentioned previously, the authors have clearly stated their
contributions and successfully achieved their goals (refer to
the ["Contribution"](#contribution) section for more details.)

## Evaluation

Well, to be honest, it is most contradictory part of the article. The authors
provide a good explanation of the evaluation process:

> We selected the following software artifacts as our experimental subjects
> from the official SPF repository1 (with the corresponding LOC): Rational.abs (
> 30), Rational.gcd (40), Ratio- nal.simplify (51), WBS.update (234) and
> WBS.launch (242) and generated in total 79 mutants with the Major mutation
> framework with the following change types: Relational
> Operator Replacement (ROR), Operator Replacement Unary (ORU), Arithmetic
> Operator Replacement (AOR) and State- ment Deletion (STD).

As you can see, the max number of LOC is 242, which is not so much. Actually, it
is small number especially for practical use. I would like to see more complex
examples with lots of LOC and more complex logic, even if the results would be
worse. Honesty on the first place.

## Readability

It is definitely worth to mention that the article is written in a good way.
In the first place it is easy to read and understand the main idea of the
article. The authors provide a good explanation of the main concepts and
background. Moreover, the article is well structured and has a logical flow,
contributions, research questions, results (despite my previous comment about
it). All of these parts are presented clearly. Maybe, a lot of people
underestimate formatting, but personally to me, it is one of the important parts
of the article, and in this case it is done well:

- All the parts have their own suitable formatting (title, code samples,
  figure names, etc.)
- Code samples have suitable font and coloring
- Tables and figures are placed in the right places, have suitable
  descriptions, clearly represent all the required information

In general, I would like to recommend the same formatting style for all other
technical articles.

# Conclusion

So, in general I would like to recommend the article for reading to whom, who is
really interesting in Symbolic Execution topic and especially in Shadow Symbolic
Execution technique. The solution described suggests interesting and applicable
algorithm for improving the original SSE algorithm. You can find interesting
the final tool that was evaluated and tested. Despite some possible critique
it's important to mention that article is mostly engineering, not research, and
suggests practical steps for algorithm improving. The best trait of the article
is "Readability", the worst is "Evaluation". Anyway, it's important to have such
articles that step-by-step improves software techniques and technologies.
