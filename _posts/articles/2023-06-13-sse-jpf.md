This is the review of the "Complete Shadow Symbolic Execution with Java
PathFinder"
article that you can find
right [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3364452.33644558).

# Meta

This article is written by four authors from Germany:
Yannic Noller, Minxing Tang, Hoang Lam Nguyen and Timo Kehrer.
Published at [ACM SIGSOFT October 2019](https://dl.acm.org/newsletter/sigsoft).
Keywords: _Regression Testing, Symbolic Execution, Symbolic PathFinder_

As you can see from the table above, this article is not so popular and has
practical value mostly.

# What is the study about?

Actually the article describes the possible way to generate test cases for
Java programs. The approach is based on Shadow Symbolic
Execution ([SSE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3208952)) which was
described in 2018 year and is just a continuation on this topic. In other words,
the approach described in the article allows to generate quite precise
tests based on the diff changes (patches) in the code.
When the old SSE approach has some limitations on finding regression bugs,
the new approach claims to find that missed bugs for the expense of total
algorithm execution time.

# Contribution

So, the authors state the next contributions:

* They propose a new approach to generate test cases based on combination of
  complete symbolic execution with the idea of four-way forking.
* The working tool that proves the idea of the article SHADOW JPF+ (extension
  for SHADOW JPF).
* The evaluation of the implemented tool based on some examples
  including [Joda-Time](https://www.joda.org/joda-time/) library.

Let's try to observe if they achieved their goals.
