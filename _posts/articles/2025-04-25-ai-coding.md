Some claim that AI will soon replace us because
it [can code better](https://barackobama.medium.com/conversation-at-hamilton-college-0c44228ac0bd)
than we can.

If you believe that, it's better to stop reading this article. Don't waste
your time. AI is a useful assistant that helps us work much faster — true.
But it’s not a replacement.

Of course, the way we work has changed. We need fewer people who mindlessly type
letters on a keyboard. Instead, we need more people who can design systems,
think at a higher level about components, understand system architecture, follow
programming best practices, and actually fix deep issues in AI-generated code.

I’m sure you’ve already heard
of [vibe coders](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vibe_coder):

> Someone who generates code by repeatedly prompting a large language model,
> and has a very limited awareness of how the code actually functions

This new approach — with its
endless [loop](https://www.index.dev/blog/vibe-coding-ai-development) of
prompt → generation → testing & refinement — wastes a lot of time, patience,
nerves, and money if used with "very limited awareness."
I got stuck in this loop myself. It just doesn’t work.

However, I’ve been coding effectively with AI tools for a while now and seem to
have found a more concise way to program with AI — one that doesn’t lead to
frustration.

So, I’d like to share several ideas that I use regularly and that work in most
cases. I hope they’ll save you time and money — and definitely speed up your
development process. But this requires much more focus and — surprise, surprise
— strong programming skills.

## Idea

To keep things simple, I’ll explain the entire process using a small example in
Go.

Let’s begin with the idea behind the issue or task—whatever it may be.
Suppose we need to parse a YAML configuration file that contains some
information about an AI model we’re going to use in our application.

As a developer, you recognize that you’ll need something capable of retrieving
specific values from this config file. Let’s express that through an interface:

```go
type Config interface {
	GetModel() (string, error)
}

```

Notice that there’s no AI involved yet (though you could ask the AI to generate
the interface as well).
There’s no implementation either.
The key point is to clearly define what you want to achieve in the end.
This is the best way to explain the task formally. In my experience, the AI
understands such definitions much better than plain English.

## Test

Now, instead of diving into implementation details straight away, we can use an
ancient technique — Test-Driven
Development ([TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).
Surprisingly, this approach helps in two important ways. First, it gives us a
test that will validate our future implementation. Second, it provides a clear
hint to the AI about what we want to implement.

Most well-known AI tools can help generate such tests.
For example, in [aider](https://aider.chat), you can use the `/add config.go`
command to add our interface, and then prompt:

```
Generate unit tests for a Config interface. Assume the implementation will load
configuration from a YAML file. The tests should simulate YAML-based input and 
validate that the interface handles it correctly.
```

_(In [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), you can use the `/tests`
command for the same purpose — no prompt
required.)_

As a result, the AI will generate something like this:

```go
const data = `
default-model: 4o
models:
  4o:
    model-id: gpt-4o
`

func TestGetModel(t *testing.T) {
	tmp, _ := os.MkdirTemp("", "configtest")
	defer os.RemoveAll(tmp)
    path := tmp + "/config.yml"
	os.WriteFile(path, []byte(data), 0644)

	config := YamlConf(path)

	model, err := config.GetModel()  
	if err != nil {                                                                                                                                                                                  
       t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)                                                                                                                                                   
    }                                                                                                                                                                                                
    if model != "gpt-4o" {                                                                                                                                                                           
       t.Errorf("Expected model ID 'gpt-4o', got %v", model)                                                                                                                                        
    }
}
```

Of course, the compiler will warn us that the `YamlConf` implementation is
missing. We can generate an empty implementation
using [IDE capabilities](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/generating-code.html),
write it manually, or ask the AI to create a skeleton for us.

Again, we don’t have a real implementation yet — just tests and a
placeholder.

At this point, we need to **review** all the generated test cases.
We might adjust our expectations, tweak the constructor, or modify test values.
By doing this, we provide the AI with as many concrete clues as possible.

## Implementation

Now we’re ready to ask the AI to implement the interface. This part is simple.
All we need to do is mention both the interface and the tests in the AI prompt
and request an implementation.

And voilà — we get a simple but functional result:

```go
type YamlConfig struct {
	Models map[string]map[string]string `yaml:"models"`
}

func YamlConf(filepath string) *YamlConfig {
	configData, err := os.ReadFile(filepath)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	var config YamlConfig
	err = yaml.Unmarshal(configData, &config)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return &config
}

func (c *YamlConfig) GetModel() (string, error) {
	model := c.DefaultModel
	return c.Models[model]["model-id"], nil
}
```

As always, you need to **review** the generated code. Think of yourself as a
code reviewer checking the work of a junior developer: the AI can assist, but
you must ensure the implementation is correct. Moreover, since we are generating
code in small and stable chunks, the review process is fairly straightforward.

During the review, you might notice that some tests fail or that the code has
flaws like duplication or inefficiencies that could be improved. In most cases,
these fixes are minor and quicker to apply manually. However, nothing stops you
from asking the AI for help. For example, you can simply paste the test failure
message into the prompt — no extra wording required. It will understand you
based on the previous context.

## Code Quality

As you may have noticed — or perhaps not — there are a few flaws in our
generated code. Actually, I didn’t spot them myself at first:

```txt
config/yamlconfig_test.go:97:17: Error return value of `os.WriteFile` is not checked (errcheck)
    os.WriteFile(path, []byte(data), 0644)
                ^
```

I noticed this issue only after running
a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)).
Sometimes we’re not familiar with the tricky edge cases or conventions of a
particular language. A convenient way to catch and fix such issues — including
formatting, styling, and even some security problems — is to
use [linters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)). For
example, you can use [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)
for Go, [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) for JavaScript, and
[Pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint) for Python. In fact, almost every
widely used programming language has its own linter or code quality tool.
Linters are especially helpful when generating code with AI — they help keep
your code clean and safe, at least to some degree.

Once again, we can either fix these issues manually or ask the AI to do it for
us.
There’s no need for a detailed prompt — just copy and paste the warning message.
The AI will understand it.
`aider` even has a
special `/lint` [command](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/commands.html) for this
exact scenario.

By the way, there’s another important aspect of code quality to consider:
conventions and preferred libraries. Some teams — or you, personally — may
follow specific practices. For example, instead of checking values in tests with
plain Go `if` statements:

```go
if err != nil {                                                                                                                                                                                  
  t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)                                                                                                                                                   
}                                                                                                                                                                                                
if model != "gpt-4o" {                                                                                                                                                                           
  t.Errorf("Expected model ID 'gpt-4o', got %v", model)                                                                                                                                        
}
```

I prefer to use the Go library [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify),
which significantly simplifies the code:

```go
assert.NoError(t, err, "Error should be nil")
assert.Equal(t, "gpt-4o", model, "Model ID should match")
```

Of course, we could rewrite our tests to use `testify`, but doing so
every time we generate a test would be tedious. And unnecessary — this problem
is already solved.

You can define a configuration file (
called [conventions](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/conventions.html) in
aider, or [rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) in Cursor)
to instruct the AI on your preferred coding practices:

```
- Use the `testify` library (`github.com/stretchr/testify`) for all Go tests.
- Prefer `assert` and `require` from `testify` over Go's standard `testing` assertions.
```

This removes the burden of constantly rewriting and rephrasing the same prompts.

## Do We Really Need to Write Tests First?

At this point, we've already discussed the core development loop:

```
interface -> test -> implementation -> code quality
```

But do we really need to write the test first?
Although I personally believe it's the fastest way to reach working code, you
can adjust the process to suit your needs.
For example, you might ask the AI to generate an implementation skeleton
_before_
writing the test — this helps avoid compiler errors early on:

```antlrv4
interface -> implementation (empty) -> test -> implementation (real) -> code quality
```

For some people, this approach may work better.
In reality, the key principle behind all of these steps is to keep the context
you're working with as small as possible — no matter which steps you put first.
Don’t add the entire application to the AI’s context, and don’t try to solve the
entire problem at once — that’s a path to nowhere.
You’ll likely spend more time fixing large blocks of AI-generated code than if
you’d built it up gradually, piece by piece.

Keep in mind: even though the AI has its own context, so do we.
And since we must constantly review the generated code, keeping the scope small
benefits us too.
This way, you're more likely to review everything carefully, which leads to
greater confidence and a more enjoyable development process.

## Final Thoughts

I encourage you to embrace AI — but don’t be a vibe coder. Be an experienced
developer — or even an architect — who treats AI as a tool to speed up the
development process.
Don’t think of it as a replacement for your expertise. Just integrate it
effectively:

- **Use interfaces and method signatures as formal requirements.**
  This gives the AI a clear structure to work from and guides it toward
  generating the code you actually need.
- **Write tests extensively.**
  Tests not only improve code quality, but also help you better understand the
  task. They also give the AI clearer objectives.
- **Be focused and concise.**
  Avoid overloading the AI with unnecessary context. The more you add, the more
  cluttered and unpredictable the output becomes — and the more time you'll
  spend cleaning it up.
- **Always review the changes.**
  AI is not perfect; it makes mistakes all the time. You are still the final
  reviewer.
- **Use linters to fix code style and catch subtle issues.**
  They’re incredibly helpful — especially when generating code with AI.

It’s also worth noting that a solid understanding of the AI tools you use will
make a big difference.
Learn the available commands, modes, supported models, and prompt techniques.
There’s always room for improvement and customization to fit your specific
workflow.

Happy coding!
