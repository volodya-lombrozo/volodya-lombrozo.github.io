# CV

Here is my CV. I build it using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). To
check the latex quality, I use the [texqc](https://github.com/yegor256/texqc)
tool.

## How to build

To build the CV, you need to
install [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)
and [texqc](https://github.com/yegor256/texqc). To build the CV, run the
following command:

```bash
make all
```

To clean the build files, run the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
